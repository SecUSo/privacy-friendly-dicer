# Privacy Friendly Dicer

[<img src="https://f-droid.org/badge/get-it-on.png" alt="Get it on F-Droid" height="60">](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer)<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer"><img src="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png" height="60"></a>

Privacy Friendly Dicer is a very simple dicing application. It can be used to roll up to 10 six-sided dice. This can be done either by pressing a button or by shaking the smartphone.

This app is optimized regarding the user's privacy. It doesn't use any tracking mechanisms, neither it displays any advertisement.

It only uses one permission: Vibration for providing feedback whether dice were rolled or not. But this can be switched on/off in the settings. If the permission is not granted in Android versions higher than 6 the device simply does not vibrate.  <br />
Privacy Friendly Dicer uses SecureRandom [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html] to get a number between 1 and 6 to determine the dicing result.

## Motivation

Privacy Friendly Dicer has been developed to provide a privacy friendly dicing application. It belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group which is developed by the SECUSO research group at Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany. More information can be found on secuso.org/pfa

## Building

Further development requires Android Studio, we recommend to use at least version 2.2.2
