The Privacy Friendly Dicer application can be used to roll between one and ten six-sided dice. It belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. More information can be found an secuso.org/pfa

The number of dice can be chosen by a slider. Rolling the dice can be done by pressing a button or shaking the smart phone. By a short vibration the app signalizes that it rolled the dice and displays the results.
It is possible to switch vibration and dicing by shaking on and off in the settings.

What makes Privacy Friendly Dicer different from other similar dicing applications?

1. Minimum amount of permissions:
The "VIBRATE" permission (category “Other”) is required to provide the vibration feedback.
Most of dicing apps in the Google Play Store require additional permissions, the top ten requires an average of 2,9 permissions (June 2016). Those are e.g. accessing the network or Internet which is mostly used to display advertisement. Some apps have access to GPS or telephony data.

2. No advertisement:
Many other apps in the Google Play Store display advertisement and therefore might violate the user’s privacy, shorten battery life or usage mobile data.
